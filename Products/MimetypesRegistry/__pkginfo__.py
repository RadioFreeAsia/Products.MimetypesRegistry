It's part of the Archetypes project, but the only requirement to use it
is to have a CMF based site. If you are using Archetypes, this package
replaces the transform package.
.
Notice this package can also be used as a standalone Python package. If
you've downloaded the Python distribution, you can't make it a Zope
product since Zope files have been removed from this distribution.
